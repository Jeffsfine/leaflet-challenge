## Background

![1-Logo](Images/1-Logo.png)

This challenge is based off of data from United States Geological Survey which is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change.

In this challenge I visualized their earthquake data using html,Javascript, and Leaflet.


## The Task

### Level 1: Earthquakes Basic Visualization

I pulled data from the [USGS GeoJSON Feed](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) , and visualized all Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days. 
 
   * The map is created by using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from the data set based on their longitude and latitude. 
   * Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and are colored with a gradient from green to red. 
   * Magnitude and Location data are shown with a popup when an individual earthquake is clicked.

### Level 2: Earthquakes Advanced Visualization

I applied a second dataset as a layer on the map to illustrate the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity. 

The tectonic plate data can be found here. <https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates>. 

Layer controls were also added in this stage.
